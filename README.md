# codequiz
This weeks project was to create an interactive code quiz for users to take.
This code quiz offers multiple choice questions.
This code quiz scores based on time left.
For each incorrect answer, 10 seconds will be taken off the time, and in turn the score.
After completion of the quiz, the user can input their initials into the highschores.
These highscores are stored on a seperate page that displays after initials are entered.
The highscores page is also available via a link on the quiz page.
